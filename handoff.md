## Current phase
Phase 7 ("After Dark", the 18+ couple's dice game) is SHIPPED on top of Phase 6. All client-side,
no migration needed. Entry: Profile > "After Dark 18+" card > /after-dark. Build clean, engine
stress-tested (120k simulated draws, 0 coherence violations).

## After Dark (Phase 7) key facts
- `lib/afterdark/engine.ts` — pure engine: 4 heat levels (Spark/Tease/Fire/Ember), tag-based
  state machine (clothing 3..0 per player, blindfold, restraints), cards declare require/effects
  so consecutive cards never contradict. Fallback logic means a draw can never come up empty.
- `lib/afterdark/deck.ts` — 112 cards (26/30/28/28 per heat). House limits baked into content:
  two players only, nothing anal (butt massage allowed), light BDSM at heat 4 only.
- `components/afterdark/AfterDarkGame.tsx` — consent gate (every entry), dice roll animation,
  card flip, per-card timers, 3 skips per player, both-hold-3s "turn up the heat" button,
  blocking Pause check-in modal, end-of-night recap. No store.tsx changes (seam untouched).
- Coherence test script (rerunnable): scratchpad simulate.ts pattern — 2000 games x 60 rounds
  asserting cardValid + clothing bounds + heat leaks.

## Previous phase (6) summary
Migration 0003 applied and verified live; identity picker, honest presence, watch-along invite
card, Movie/Series filter, shared AI chat all shipped and deployed from main.

## Shipped this session (see context.md 5d for detail)
1. Display identity: app knows Panda vs Hermi; picker on every open, PIN once per device switch.
2. 1h idle re-lock + activity tracking.
3. Honest presence (heartbeat + freshness; offline on tab hide/close/idle).
4. Watch-along: invite card instead of takeover; cancel/Later are permanent; DB session hygiene.
5. Movie/Series filter (Browse, Watchlist, mood-quiz hard filter); fake Discover loader removed.
6. Shared couple-synced AI chat with attribution + partner notification.
7. Cleanup: OTP dead code + API.rtf deleted, profile Reset fixed, em-dash sweep, couple.jpg
   compressed, `server-only` pinned, `outputFileTracingRoot` set.

## Next steps
- Two-device E2E test (the script is in the plan/context): both log in, presence, invite card,
  sticky cancel, shared AI thread, idle re-lock.
- Optional: compress `public/icon-512.png` (~480K; needs pngquant or similar, sips can't shrink it).
- Optional: delete stray `/Users/eyoel/package-lock.json` (84 bytes, outside the repo; the
  `outputFileTracingRoot` setting already neutralizes it).

## Known gaps (accepted)
- `/us` activity feed is not synced to Supabase (rebuilt locally, resets on live refetch).
- Push notifications when the PWA is closed: future phase.

## Key locations
- Plans/state: `context.md` (living memory), `instructions.md` (patterns playbook).
- Identity/idle/presence: `lib/identity.ts`, `lib/activity.ts`, `lib/live.ts` (trackPresence).
- Watch-along: `components/watch/WatchParty.tsx`, `components/watch/PartyInvite.tsx`,
  `lib/session-prefs.ts`, `supabase/migrations/0003_sessions_ai.sql`.
- AI chat: `lib/store.tsx` (askAi), `lib/live.ts` (push.aiMessage), `components/ai/AssistantButton.tsx`.
- Credentials: `.env.local` (Gemini, Supabase, TMDB) and `.env.netlify.local`. Paths only, never
  values, per workspace rules. The Supabase DB password is NOT stored on this machine.
- Accounts: panda@amoremovies.app / hermi@amoremovies.app, PIN 9009, couple AM-427CD.
